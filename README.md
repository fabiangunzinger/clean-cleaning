Clean data cleaning in Python


todo:

[] Checklist of basic data cleaning steps and idiomatic implementations.


## Motivation

- Checklists reduce mistakes in medicine and many other domains, yet my
    experience is that they are chronically underused in the data-heavy tasks.
    Most people don't like data cleaning and don't give it a lot of thought,
    others feel that each dataset is unique so that no general guidelines are
    helpful. I disagree, and am convinced that just like in medicine and other
    fields, a simple checklist together with idiomatic implementations to tackle
    repeated cleaning steps can dramatically reduce coding time and errors and
    -- ultimately -- make analysis more reliable.

    data cleaning in Pandas.
